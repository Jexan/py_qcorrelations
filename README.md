## py_correlations

This is a work-in-progress package for working with qubits and qutrits correlations in Python in a Flexible way. 

This package includes many common elements, like SU(2) and SU(3), some common quantum channels and functions to deal with some correlations (Negativity, MID, AMID, Quantum Discord).

This package was used for my Thesis, and will be used for future papers.
